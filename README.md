# lesson26 - The List

## Overview

In this lesson we are going to implement our own data structure that implements the List Interface
from Java.

## Task 1 - Write Unit tests

Our first task is to write tests that test each method defined in MyListTest.java. At this point
we may not know 100% of the cases that we need to test our goal is to just have basic coverage
and make sure that all our code compiles. At this point we expect our tests to fail!

In your starter code you will see the file **MyList.java** that implements the **LL.java**
interface. You need to write test for each method that do the following.

- pass null to any method parameter that takes an object
- check all the return values. You can update these later as you start to work on the code

## Task 2 - Complete the MyListN class

Now that we have completed a set of tests for our list it is now time to start coding something up.
We will need to now completed all the methods in the file **MyList.java**.  Hopefully once we are
done writing our list class all the tests that we wrote in a previous lab will start passing!

You may want to update, add, or modify any tests in **MyListTest.java** to reflect your new
implementation.

## Task 3 - Complete the MyListA class

Now that we have completed a set of tests for our list it is now time to start coding something up.
In this implementation you **must** use an array as your backing data structure, you can't use nodes
like you did in [lesson26]({% link _cs2/lessons/lesson26.md %}). We will need to now completed all
the methods in the file **MyList.java**.  Hopefully once we are done writing our list class all the
tests that we wrote in a previous lab will start passing!

You may want to update, add, or modify any tests in **MyListTest.java** to reflect your new
implementation.

## Task 4 - Efficiency Experiments

You will need to use your list implementations to see if there are any differences.

## Task 1 - Construct tests

In your starter code repo you will find a file named **App.java**. You will need to construct a
series of tests and output timings for each. You will then need to complete the efficiency section
in your README.md reporting your findings.

## Prepare for submission.

This is the final stage in the project! Your project will be graded according to the standard
[grading rubric]({% link _cs2/docs/grading-rubric.md %}) so make sure your code is 100% ready to
go and push everything to github for grading!
