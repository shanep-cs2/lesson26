## Overview

In this lesson we are going to implement our own data structure that implements the List Interface
from Java.

## Task 1 - Write Unit tests

Our first task is to write tests that test each method defined in MyListTest.java. At this point
we may not know 100% of the cases that we need to test our goal is to just have basic coverage
and make sure that all our code compiles. At this point we expect our tests to fail!

In your starter code you will see the file **MyList.java** that implements the **LL.java**
interface. You need to write test for each method that do the following.

- pass null to any method parameter that takes an object
- check all the return values. You can update these later as you start to work on the code

## Task 2 - Complete the MyList class

Now that we have completed a set of tests for our list it is now time to start coding something up.
We will need to now completed all the methods in the file **MyList.java**.  Hopefully once we are
done writing our list class all the tests that we wrote in a previous lab will start passing!

You may want to update, add, or modify any tests in **MyListTest.java** to reflect your new
implementation.


## Task 3 - Complete the Retrospective

Once you have completed all the tasks open the file Retrospective.md and complete each section with
a TODO comment.

## Task 4 - Add, Commit, Push your code

Once you are finished you need to make sure that you have pushed all your code to GitHub for
grading!
